# BasketballAnalytics

A series of tools I wrote in order to help me analyze basketball statistics and player performance for fantasy basketball.

stats.py scrapes and cleans data from ESPN and other sources.

algorithm.py ranks players by performance in various statistical categories, and puts data into a table for use.

Head to Head Comparison.ipynb retrieves fantasy basketball rosters from ESPN and compares the estimated performance and strengths of each team.
